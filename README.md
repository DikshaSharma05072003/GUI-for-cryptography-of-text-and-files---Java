## GUI for encryption and decryption

Developed a Java-based Graphical User Interface (GUI) for encrypting and decrypting text and pdf and image files using the Caesar cipher. The application allows users to securely encode and decode their data with ease. This project demonstrates my skills in Java programming and cryptographic techniques.
